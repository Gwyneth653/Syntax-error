### Project 6: Housing prices

## Introduction
Given a provided dataset with 1460 houses and their sales price. We build a model to accurately estimate the values of houses in Ames Iowa.

We build roughly 4 different models to compare which model was most suitable for our problem. 

## Model 1: univariate and multivariate linear regression model

## Model 2: univariate and multivariate polynomial regression model

## Model 3: Random Forest/Tree Regressor model

## Model 4: Neural Network
